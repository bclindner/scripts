# Brian's Scripts

This repo is a catch-all for smaller (yet still useful) scripts that I use to do
simpler tasks and solve problems of fairly narrow scope.

These are mostly written in Python, my weapon of choice for desktop scripting.
Each file has a comment block at the top of the file which describes what it is
and how to use it, as well as some of my thoughts on the script.

This repository is available on both
[GitHub](https://github.com/bclindner/scripts) and
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/bclindner/scripts).
